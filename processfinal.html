        <div id="statement"><br><h2 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px;">Artist Statement</h2><br><p style="line-height: 1.25;">My work in this project represents the mental experience of being given a deadline or due date. I expect my audience to feel an overwhelming sense of stress. My goal was for the audience to want the experience to be over and done soon. This is how I feel about due dates, and I achieved this feeling for the audience with the distracting background visuals and loud clock sounds. I experimented with bright colors for the first time in this project. The colors and other design choices in this project were heavily inspired by letting loose from my “polished” aesthetics and having fun in a way that code was used in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This project does not fit in with any work I have done before. I have worked with coding HTML and CSS before, but this project is a lot more kitschy than my web projects before. 
        <br><br>This project was my first time working with javascript to add an interactive element to the works. Javascript was crucial to this project. There are two main elements of this project, visuals and audio. Javascript was used in this project to automate the audio and add pause and play functions to the audio. The sound was very important to the project because the feelings of urgency come from the sounds. The clock sounds trigger a mental panic as the audience tries to figure out why they are panicked.

    <div id="reflection"><br><br><h2 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px;">Project Reflection</h2><br><p style="line-height: 1.25;">Through the process of this project, I have learned a lot about Javascript and user interactivity. There was a lot of trial and error with trying to program the functions of my audio elements with Javascript. I tried a few different ways of programming it that were demonstrated to me in class, but I didn’t have much success. I did a lot of outsourced research to find ways that would work for playing audio almost automatically when you open the tab. I also have better research skills because of it. I really didn’t like how frustrating it was when there would be an issue in my code or something wouldn’t work. Creating these projects really helped my patience grow. I liked how accomplished I felt once I found a solution for my code that worked. I am really proud of how the project turned out. I am already wanting to revisit previous web projects to add more color and Javascript elements to them. I use to stay with very neutral color palettes, but after using more bright colors in this project makes me want to incorporate them in my future projects too.</p></div>
